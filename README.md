# ScalarIQ Playground

## In a Nutshell

This is an interactive web-tool for playing around with ScalarIQ
compiler and evaluator in o web browser. All evaluations take place in
the client side browser.

## What is ScalarIQ?

*ScalarIQ* is a lightweight, portable scalar expression language designed
for evaluating scalar values from diverse external inputs. It is
particularly useful for scenarios like periodically calculating
automation results from sensor data. *ScalarIQ* is not a general-purpose
programming language; it is intentionally not Turing complete, lacking
loops and recursion to ensure predictable and finite execution
time. The language evaluates expressions that reduce to a single
scalar valueâ€”number, boolean, string, or NULL.
